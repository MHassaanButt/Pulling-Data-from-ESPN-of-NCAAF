# Pulling-Data-from-ESPN-of-NCAAF
In this project, I pull data from ESPN for college football matches. Navigate to ESPN's college football scores. You should see the scores from the top 25 ranked teams. Select 3 games you will pull data from. If OSU or BYU is in the top 25, then you will use them for this project; otherwise, you are free to select any team. For each game, I used soup, retrieve the play-by-play data for all types of plays, not just scoring plays.
If the Play-by-Play link is not shown, then using soup you can navigate to the play-by-play information by clicking the Box Score link; then on the menu that appears on the new webpage, click Play-by-Play.
we will need to create a dataframe with 3 columns: play, team, and opponent. Insert each individual play as a record into the dataframe where play contains the text of the play, team contains the name of the team who is on offense, and opponent is the name of the team playing defense.
